\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we proposed {\em Simple Configurable Classifiers} (SCC),
a new approach for continuous mobile sensing.  In this approach, the
platform implements common sensor data processing algorithms that
execute on a low-power sensor hub, and application developers
construct simple configurable classifiers for events of interest by
selecting among the set of pre-defined common processing
algorithms and tuning their parameters.  We presented an extensive 
evaluation showing the benefits of using simple configurable
classifiers as wake-up mechanisms the for multiple accelerometer and 
audio-based applications.

Our immediate future work includes developing an FPGA-based prototype,
performing a thorough exploration of what algorithms should 
be included as part of the platform and analysing their power and 
computational requirements.  Further future work aims at tackling 
the remaining challenges described in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}.
